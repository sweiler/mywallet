mywallet web application
=========================

mywallet is an application for keeping track of your personal financial
situation. It is mainly a web-application but you can use it offline as well.
Users can sign up for the application and can add *entries* to *lists*.

An *entry* is a single transaction of money from or to your wallet or bank
account. A user can distinguish between wallets or different bank accounts
by addressing them as a *list*.
